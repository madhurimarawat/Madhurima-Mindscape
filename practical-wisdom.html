    <h2>Practical Wisdom</h2>

    <section class="intro">
        <p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
            “Life is a journey, not a destination. Along the way, we learn, grow, and discover the truths that shape
            us.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Throughout our lives, we encounter moments of reflection, growth, and transformation. These experiences
            often provide us
            with invaluable lessons that help guide us through both challenges and opportunities. Here, I’ll share some
            of the most
            insightful tips and wisdom I've gained from my personal journey.

            <h3>Celebrate Small Victories</h3>
            <p>Don’t overlook the small wins. Successfully completing a project, finishing a presentation, or even
                conquering
                your fears are all victories worth celebrating. These moments create a sense of accomplishment and
                contribute to
                overall contentment in life.</p>
            <p>When tackling bigger tasks, break them down into smaller, achievable goals. I remember when I worked on
                my minor
                project in the 7th semester. I divided the project into several tasks: first drafting the idea, then
                collecting
                data, and so on. It’s not just about breaking tasks into smaller pieces; celebrating each small victory
                along
                the way is what keeps the momentum going. These little wins give a huge boost to confidence.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“The little victories along the way are the stepping stones to bigger successes. Celebrate them as
                    you go.”
                </p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-item">
            <h3>Vent Out Your Frustrations</h3>
            <p>Life can be frustrating at times, and it's important to let those feelings out. Cry, laugh, dance,
                sing—whatever
                helps you release the stress. Don’t bottle it up, as it only leads to more frustration. Sometimes, we
                lack
                someone to talk to, but we can always rely on ourselves for support.</p>
            <p>When I feel frustrated, I head to my rooftop. It's quiet, peaceful, and gives me space to think. I
                reflect on why
                I started and why I won’t stop. This kind of retrospection helps me accept whatever challenges I face,
                whether
                it's frustration, jealousy, or failure. It's crucial to understand what went wrong and use that
                knowledge to
                move forward.</p>
            <p>When seeking help from others, find someone trustworthy, not someone who might use your struggles against
                you. If
                no one is available, remember that you are your own best company. Hobbies also play a big role in easing
                frustration. Whenever I feel down, I focus on my other hobbies, like photography or listening to music.
                Finding
                a song that matches your mood can help you feel less frustrated and more at peace.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Sometimes, venting out your frustrations is the first step towards healing. Don’t bottle it up.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-item">
            <h3>Enjoy the Small Things</h3>
            <p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Whenever I’m on any journey or even a simple trip, like from my
                home to the
                market, I try to notice every little thing around me. Maybe a random kid smiles at me or my regular
                shopkeeper
                gives me a discount. Sometimes, these small signs are enough to make my day.</p>
            <p>The key is to focus on the glass being half-full. Always focus on what you have, instead of what you
                don't. Even
                during your regular visits, try to find something to cherish — a photo, a joke, a lesson, or even a
                funny roast.
                It may seem like small things, but they have a big impact. Always notice them because sometimes, this is
                all we
                need to cheer up.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Happiness is not in the big things, but in the small moments we tend to overlook.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-item">
            <h3>Give Yourself Some Time</h3>
            <p>This is one of the most important lessons I’ve learned: Don’t think that everything will change in a day,
                but
                trust that it will eventually change. Keep hustling and keep doing better. Trust me, you’re doing good
                even if
                no one is watching. Be your own admirer and acknowledge the little things you do — those small efforts
                and steps
                forward are great.</p>
            <p>I always remind myself of this, especially when I feel like things are not going the way I want. When
                I’ve helped
                someone or done something that made me feel good, I make sure to give myself some time to recharge. I
                take a
                break, then I restart with renewed energy.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“It’s okay to pause. You’ll come back stronger. Give yourself the grace you give others.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-item">
            <h3>You Are Unique — Don’t Let Others’ Success Overshadow Yours</h3>
            <p>We are all built differently, and as a result, we can never measure our success or achievements by
                someone else’s
                standards. The truth is, don’t feel bad about being different in any way. Maybe we’re not good at one
                thing, but
                that’s okay — find your own strengths and focus on them.</p>
            <p>Do not change for someone else. Change for yourself — for your growth, for your desire to become a better
                person.
                Embrace your uniqueness, because that’s what makes you stand out and gives you the potential to achieve
                things
                that are true to who you are.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Success is not a comparison; it’s about becoming the best version of yourself.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-item">
            <h3>Don’t Take Criticism to Heart</h3>
            <p>The thing is, we all make mistakes, and that’s absolutely fine. In the beginning, it’s easy to feel
                overly
                protective or defensive when someone points out our errors, even if it’s done through taunts. But it's
                okay —
                after all, we’re only affected by something when we haven’t fully accepted it.</p>
            <p>Take every criticism as an opportunity to grow. Analyze it, inspect it, introspect on it, but never let
                it make
                you feel small or discouraged. See it as a chance to improve — whether it’s your project, yourself, or
                anything
                you’re struggling with. Criticism is a stepping stone toward becoming a better version of yourself.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Criticism is not a reflection of your worth; it's an opportunity for growth and improvement.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-item">
            <h3>Help Others If You Can</h3>
            <p>There’s no problem in helping others, and the key is to feel grateful that you’re capable of doing so. I
                always
                try to assist, no matter how small the contribution may be. Seeing someone else grateful or even just
                smiling
                because of your help is a truly rewarding feeling — cherish it.</p>
            <p>However, don't allow people to walk all over you. Help, but also ensure that you communicate your
                boundaries and
                make others understand the value of your assistance.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“The joy of helping others lies not just in what you do, but in knowing your support makes a
                    difference.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-item">
            <h3>Start Somewhere</h3>
            <p>When you feel overwhelmed by too many paths and can’t decide which one to take, it’s better to just start
                and
                figure things out along the way. From my personal experience, I was completely confused about web
                development,
                backend, frontend, data science — so many options! But I just started with frontend development, loved
                it, then
                moved on to data science and realized it was my true calling. That’s how I learned and continue to
                learn.</p>
            <p>It’s okay to be confused. I remember when I started with GitHub, I thought, “What good could I possibly
                do? I’m a
                complete beginner!” I wasn’t even sure what project to create, but I just started, and things gradually
                made
                sense. The key is to start, fail, and keep going. It’s better to fail than to never start at all.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Starting is the first step toward success. The road may be unclear, but action will always lead to
                    progress.”</p>
            </blockquote>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <p>Ultimately, life is a series of lessons and experiences that shape who we are. Embrace the journey,
            celebrate the
            small victories, and remember that growth comes from both success and failure. Stay true to yourself,
            help others
            when you can, and always keep moving forward. The key is to never stop learning and evolving.</p>
