    <!--
      The <base> tag sets the base URL for all relative URLs in this document.
    
       means:
    
      - "Start resolving relative URLs from two folders above the current file location."
      - Each "../" moves up one directory level.
        So "../../" moves up two levels.
    
      Example:
        If this file is at /blogs/tech/article.html,
        then "../../" points to the root folder of your project.
    
      Why use "../../"?
      - To correctly link shared resources like CSS, JS, images,
        which are stored at higher directory levels.
      
      Why not use "./" or "/"?
      - "./" means current directory; won't work for deeply nested files.
      - "/" means site root; may break if hosted in subfolders or GitHub Pages.
    
      Place the <base> tag inside <head> before all relative URLs.
      Only one <base> tag is allowed per document.

        <p>Welcome to Madhurima Mindscape, a space where technology, art, and passion converge. I’m Madhurima Rawat, a
            final-year B.Tech (Hons.) student in Computer Science and Engineering (Data Science), blending technical
            expertise
            with creative exploration. Dive into my journey of continuous growth, varied interests, and the joy of
            connecting

    <section class="intro">
        <h3>Welcome to My Personal Space!</h3>
        <p>This is my personal website, created as a central place for sharing my thoughts, projects, and experiences.
            Here, you’ll find a mix of tech articles, personal stories, and insights into my creative process.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="idea">
        <h3>How It All Started</h3>
        <p>During a moment of inspiration, I realized I needed a space to share my ideas, experiences, and the things
            I’m learning. GitHub felt too focused on code, and LinkedIn was too formal for personal stories. So, I
            created this website to strike a balance between both professional and personal content.</p>
        <p>It's a place where I can share both my technical projects and personal insights in a way that feels true to
            me—professional, but also a bit more approachable and human.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="categories">

    <section class="about-tech">
        <h3>Tech Insights</h3>
        <p>In this section, I share my experiences and insights with various tools, platforms, and technologies. I focus
            on providing honest and practical advice, aiming to help others learn from both my successes and challenges.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="purpose">
        <h3>Why This Website?</h3>
        <p>The main reason I created this website is to have a personal space to share everything I learn, think, and
            create. GitHub and LinkedIn serve specific professional purposes, but I wanted something more personal and
            versatile to showcase both my technical knowledge and my personal experiences.</p>
        <p>You'll find that the professional content—like technical insights and project details—is presented in a
            straightforward, helpful way. While I aim to keep the tech sections professional, I’ll sprinkle in a little
            humor here and there to make things more engaging. Even in technical topics, I believe a touch of lightness
            can
            make learning more enjoyable, and memes will occasionally make an appearance for a good laugh!</p>
        <p>If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to reach out via my <a
                href="mailto:rawatmadhurima@gmail.com">email</a>.
            I’m always open to feedback or new ideas!</p>
        <p>While this website primarily serves as a personal blog, I have a separate portfolio for my professional
            projects.
            You can also find the GitHub repository for this website linked in the navbar if you’d like to contribute or
            offer suggestions.</p>
    </section>


    <section class="organization">
        <h3>How I Organized It All</h3>
        <p>The content on this website is organized into categories that make navigation simple. Whether you're here for
            technical resources, personal stories, or just to enjoy some photography, everything is easily accessible.
            As the site grows, I’ll continue to add new articles and keep everything organized.</p>
