        <p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
            “Some years teach you by rushing past.
            Some years teach you by making you wait.”

        <p class="dropcap">
            2025 felt like a year of waiting. I kept waiting and waiting, without really knowing what for or how long.
            At
            the start
            of the year, everything felt normal: New Year wishes, the usual excitement, and the 7th semester exams
            almost
            done.
            Naturally, my thoughts shifted to the 8th semester, what else do you do at that point? I felt excited, but
            also strangely
            nostalgic, knowing that BTech had not ended yet, but it was getting close.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the year went on, there were moments when it felt static, like nothing was really happening. I was
            waiting
            for
            clarity, for answers, for something to finally make sense. But slowly, I realized that even in the waiting,
            life was
            quietly teaching me lessons. These phases, moments, and small realizations shaped my final year of college
            and left me
            with reflections I know I will carry forward.

            <h3>The Weight of Becoming a Graduate</h3>
            <p>
                After completing my internship, a recurring thought stayed with me, BTech was coming to an end. Soon, I
                would not just be a student anymore; I would be a graduate, with real responsibilities waiting ahead.
                That
                realization actually hit me back in the 6th semester, especially because my internship was offline and I
                was not going to college regularly for almost 3 to 4 months.
            </p>

            <h3>Finding Joy in a Quiet Semester</h3>
            <p>
                The 8th semester began on a regular Monday. Classes resumed, but the environment felt different. The
                class
                strength was much lower than previous semesters, as many students were away doing internships. Barely
                three or four of us, including me, attended classes regularly. Surprisingly, it was calm, peaceful, and
                enjoyable in its own way.

            <h3>Keep Moving, Keep Searching</h3>
            <p>
                One major challenge came during our cloud computing lab. We needed platforms like AWS or Azure, which
                required a credit card. I did not have one, so I spent weeks searching for free alternatives. For a
                while,
                nothing worked, and I almost gave up. But eventually, after more digging, I discovered LocalStack, a
                simple
                yet effective solution.
            </p>

            <h3>Turning Boredom into Growth</h3>
            <p>
                After semesters of constant exams, suddenly having a two month gap felt overwhelming. With nothing
                urgent
                to prepare for, boredom set in. Instead of letting it consume me, I shifted my focus to building
                projects.
                I explored new ideas, sharpened my skills, and created things I am genuinely proud of.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>
                    “Free time is a gift, use it to grow, explore, and become better than yesterday.”
                </p>

        <div class="reflection-item">
            <h3>The Last Day That Stayed With Me</h3>
            <p>
                The last day at college arrived quietly. We clicked pictures, signed shirts, and shared laughs. It was a
                strange mix of happiness and nostalgia. Looking back, college turned out far better than I ever expected
                when I started in 2021, great friends, supportive teachers, meaningful learning, and memories I will
                always
                cherish.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>

        <div class="reflection-item">
            <h3>Doing Things Just for Me</h3>
            <p>
                After college ended, I finally made space for hobbies, art, craft, and small creative experiments. I am
                not
                an artist in the traditional sense, but creating without pressure felt healing. It reminded me that not
                everything needs to be productive or perfect.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>
                    “Do things for joy, not outcomes. Sometimes, happiness itself is the achievement.”
                </p>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <p>
            This is what defined this year for me, this semester, my college life, and everything that came with it.
            Every phase taught me something new, whether it was patience, gratitude, or simply learning to enjoy the
            moment as it comes. I am looking forward to many more such moments, meaningful people, new experiences,
            skills, and learning opportunities in my life ahead.
