    <section class="intro">
        <p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">“Every second holds a journey. Every minute carries a story. Every hour, every
            day,
            every week, and
            every year unfolds
            as a unique path to explore.”</blockquote>
        </p>
        <p class="dropcap">
            2024 was truly a remarkable one, filled with moments of stress and uncertainty but culminating in a deep
            sense
            of
            fulfillment. It was the year I stepped out of my comfort zone, explored countless opportunities, and
            embraced
            the joy of
            doing what truly made me happy. Along the way, I learned some invaluable lessons that shaped my perspective.
            Here are a
            few reflections that stand out:</p>
    </section>

    <section class="reflections">

        <div class="reflection-item">
            <h3>After Darkness, There Is Light</h3>
            <p>In the beginning, applying for internships was tough. I was frustrated with the lack of replies, and
                on
                top of
                that, my academic marks were dependent on securing an internship. Despite the struggles, I kept
                working
                on
                improving my resume and skills. Eventually, my persistence paid off, and I secured an internship
                that
                turned out
                to be an amazing experience.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Nothing comes easy, but if you keep hustling and believe in yourself, what is meant for you will
                    eventually
                    come your way. Just keep pushing forward!”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection-item">
            <h3>Learn From Mistakes</h3>
            <p>When I first started learning a new tool like InfluxDB, I made several mistakes. I tried to rely on
                the
                documentation, but it wasn’t quite helping, so I explored alternative solutions and found the right
                path. Now,
                whenever I learn a new tool, I always make sure to go through the documentation first, and I’ve
                learned
                how
                important it is to understand the basics before experimenting. </p>

            <p>It’s necessary to learn not only from
                our
                own
                mistakes but also from others’ mistakes, so we don’t repeat them. Success stories are great, but
                failure
                stories
                are needed for us and others to learn from them.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Mistakes are part of the process, but learning from them is what truly matters.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection-item">
            <h3>Challenges Mean Opportunity</h3>
            <p>No matter the challenge, whether it’s learning a new tool, facing a tough project, or even working on
                a
                new idea
                or website, challenges are always opportunities for growth. I see every challenge as a chance to
                learn
                something
                new. The key is to embrace the discomfort, because that’s where the real learning happens.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Projects that push you out of your comfort zone often lead to the greatest personal and
                    professional
                    development.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection-item">
            <h3>Don’t Be Scared to Ask Questions</h3>
            <p>One of the things I learned during my internship was the ability to ask questions. Initially, we feel
                like asking
                anything will make us look stupid, but this is not the case. Articulation is important for us to ask
                anything.
                Asking is better than assuming, and in turn, much better than doing something wrong, regretting it,
                and
                having
                to redo it.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Asking questions helps avoid mistakes and makes us grow.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection-item">
            <h3>A New Idea is a Blessing</h3>
            <p>Every time you have a new idea, no matter how stupid or silly it may seem, it’s always good to think
                about it.
                These little ideas and projects help us build things we never thought were possible. When I first
                had
                the idea
                for my portfolio, my first thought was, “Is this a good idea?” or even for my other projects. </p>

            <p>But in
                the
                process, I realized it is indeed very important to have an idea to explore, similar ideas to build
                upon,
                and to
                mold your own unique one. It’s honestly great, and in the end, the satisfaction is immense.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Every idea, no matter how small, is the seed for something great.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection-item">
            <h3>Turn Stoppages or Issues into Opportunities</h3>
            <p>So, when I was doing a project on GPT, I realized that the data was limited. So, I turned to web
                scraping. I
                thought others might face the same issue, so I made a web scraper for this. This was my first
                project
                that made
                me feel good. Always try to convert your hurdles or problems into opportunities. Maybe it’s lack of
                resources,
                documentation, or communication issues. Always try to solve the issues, it always pays back.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Challenges are opportunities in disguise. Seize them!”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection-item">
            <h3>Document Your Things</h3>
            <p>Between any project, being a yay or nay, documentation is key. Even other things, like simple
                communication, fail
                if there is no documentation. It’s always better to have a well-written document, script, or other
                references.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Good documentation helps save time and avoid confusion.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection-item">
            <h3>Finish Early</h3>
            <p>No matter what you are trying to do, try to finish it before the deadline. This way, even if there
                are
                some
                last-minute setbacks, you still have time to recover. I always go by this rule: anything I plan in
                advance, I
                try to finish early so that I have additional time to make adjustments.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Early completion gives you breathing room for unexpected challenges.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection-item">
            <h3>Do Your Work, Do Not Focus on Results</h3>
            <p>The thing is, we need to give our 100%. Results may not necessarily come in our favor, but that
                doesn’t
                matter. We must keep doing our work, and someday it will all make sense. Try to keep your projects
                100%
                good, the
                results and the rest are not in our hands.</p>
            <p>When I was new to making projects, my sole ambition was to have a lot of engagements. I wanted to
                collaborate
                with people, learn new things, and be appreciated. This happens to all of us, it’s completely normal.
                The
                truth
                is,
                results are never in our hands. So, just be happy with the learning part, as it always happens no
                matter
                what
                else
                unfolds.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Just keep doing your work and trust the process. The journey matters more than the destination,
                    and
                    success
                    will follow when the time is right.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection-item">
            <h3>Life Is a Journey, Not a Destination</h3>
            <p>Do not force yourself to have a perfect ending, it’s not meant to be that way. When we are studying,
                we
                feel like getting a job is the ultimate destination. Then, when we start working, it becomes about
                increments,
                promotions, and more. This cycle never ends. It’s always better to enjoy the journey, the laughter,
                tears, joys,
                and
                sorrows, everything that life throws at you. After all, these memories are what make life truly
                memorable.</p>
            <p>During school, I used to think college would be my ultimate destination, a place where I’d learn
                everything,
                get a job, and secure my life. But no, it’s not like that. There are still insecurities and
                uncertainties, no
                matter
                how hard we try. It’s completely fine because maybe destiny has other plans for us, plans better than
                our
                own.
                The
                key is to enjoy the journey, to embrace everything that comes, so that when our goals are finally
                reached, we
                can
                look back satisfied, knowing we truly enjoyed everything in between.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Embrace the journey of life. Every moment, every emotion, every experience adds richness to your
                    story,
                    making it unforgettable.”</p>
            </blockquote>

        </div>

    </section>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <p>As I continue on this journey, I remain committed to learning, evolving, and embracing every challenge
            that comes my
            way. Life is a collection of lessons, and it's through reflection that we find growth. Here's to more
            experiences,
            more wisdom, and more moments that define our paths. Let's keep exploring and creating, one step at a
            time.</p>
